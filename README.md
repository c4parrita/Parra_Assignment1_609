# Parra_Assignment1_609

1) 12.5 points - You will write a program in Python/R/C (just pick a language you like – I’m listing ones here that I prefer) that will take as input a FASTQ file and print the distribution of quality scores across all reads. You can summarize the distribution of Q scores at each base with a statistic of your choice (e.g. mean, mode, median, quantile distribution). If you’d like, you can also plot the distribution of Q scores as a box plot much like what’s generated by FASTQC. You will then run your program on the provided FASTQ file, and obtain the output from it. You'll find this FASTQ file under Files->Assignment Files->assignment1.fastq.


2) 12.5 points - You will write a program in Python/R/C (again, I don't care what language you use - just use something that you're comfortable with) to read a FASTQ file as input, along with the kmer length (user-input), then construct a de Bruijn graph from the reads. Provide the output as two separate files - (a) a file containing a list of the nodes, and (b) a file that contains the list of edges. You will then run your program on the provided FASTQ file, and obtain the output from it. You'll find this FASTQ file under Files->Assignment Files->assignment1.fastq.
